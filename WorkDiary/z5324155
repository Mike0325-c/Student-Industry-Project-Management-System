Week 1
Our group was formed and named. We selected Jiayang as our Scrum Master and created the Jira Site. 
We were struggling to choose one of the 25 projects and done some brainstorming on this. We deleted 
several topics that we were not interested in and analyzed the techniques used in each topic to 
ensure that the topics we selected were within our acceptable range.
Week2
We determined the project we wanted to choose and then held a meeting on Tuesday and assigned work. 
Jiayang was responsible for the background. The other two members and I were responsible for the user stories first. 
I was responsible for the student part.

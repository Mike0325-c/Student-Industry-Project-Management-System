The group has been established and named. We've appointed a Scrum Master and set up the Jira Site. 
We've also engaged in discussions about the project we intend to undertake, including the programming language and the preliminary selection of libraries and functions. 
Concurrently, we have outlined rough work allocations for the project, differentiating between backend and frontend tasks. 
Looking ahead, we are planning to convene another meeting on Tuesday of week 2, to delve deeper into the work allocation proposal. 
In the interim, we will utilize the time between meetings to enhance our understanding of our project.

Week 1
The group has been established and named. We've appointed a Scrum Master and set up the Jira Site. 
We've also engaged in discussions about the project we intend to undertake, including the programming language and the preliminary selection of libraries and functions. 
Concurrently, we have outlined rough work allocations for the project, differentiating between backend and frontend tasks. 
Looking ahead, we are planning to convene another meeting on Tuesday of week 2, to delve deeper into the work allocation proposal. 
In the interim, we will utilize the time between meetings to enhance our understanding of our project.

Week 2
On Tuesday, we convened a meeting to discuss the scope of work for each team member and I started to work on the user story for industry partner. 
During this process, we effectively addressed scheduling conflicts through open a communication. 
Our plan is to complete the demo proposal and undertake the peer review process at least one day before the submission deadline.

Week 3
From Tuesday to Thursday, we held a series of meetings to collaborate on the proposal. 
To enhance efficiency, we adjusted our workload distribution according to our individual strengths and weaknesses we found during the process. 
My new duty was finishing user stories for all parties and I successfully finished the target. 
Looking ahead, we intend to schedule another meeting next Sunday or Monday to allocate project-related tasks and further discuss the expectations for delivering cooperation process functionalities.
